<p>
    First of all: please <font color="#007000"><b>do not e-mail feature suggestions directly</b></font> to the
    developers
    (unless you would like to <font color="#007000"><b>sponsor the development</b></font>). There are two much better
    places
    for feature requests:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=14067&amp;atid=364067">Feature Request
        Tracker</a> on the SourceForge.net site (see the details below);
    </li>
    <li><a href="lists.php">TightVNC mailing lists</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using the Feature Request Tracker</h3>
<p>
    The tracker helps to keep all the requests for enhancements <font color="#007000"><b>in one place</b></font>, and to
    find a
    source of information if we would decide to implement a particular feature. Go through the
    following steps when sending a feature suggestion:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>If you have not <font color="#007000"><b>registered</b></font> on the SourceForge.net Web site, please do that
        before
        posting a feature request (see more information below).
    </li>
    <li>Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=14067&amp;atid=364067">feature
        request
        tracker</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Make sure you are <font color="#007000"><b>logged in</b></font>.</li>
    <li><font color="#007000"><b>Search existing requests</b></font> for similar features. If it's already there, just
        post another comment, instead of adding a similar item to the tracker.
    </li>
    <li>If you have not found an existing feature request, consider adding a new one.</li>
    <li>Choose an <font color="#007000"><b>informative subject line</b></font>.</li>
    <li>Describe the suggested feature providing <font color="#007000"><b>as many details as possible</b></font>,
        including
        links to existing examples, similar software etc.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Why Registration Is Necessary?</h3>
<p>
    Technically, it is possible to post a feature request anonymously. The registration simply
    enables sending you <font color="#007000"><b>notifications on any changes</b></font> in the request status. Also, as
    a
    registered user, you will automatically receive all the comments attached to your request.
    Note that such comments can include clarification inquires from project developers, or
    information on possible alternative solutions.
