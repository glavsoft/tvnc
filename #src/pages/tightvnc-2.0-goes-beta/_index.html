<h3 align="center">TightVNC 2.0 Goes Beta</h3>
<p>
    February 23, 2010 – GlavSoft LLC. has released TightVNC 2.0 Beta 1. This is the first
    public preview of the upcoming TightVNC 2.0 release for Windows systems.
</p>
<p>
    TightVNC is a free software package that shows the desktop of a remote computer and allows to
    control it with local mouse and keyboard, just like it was a local computer. TightVNC comes
    with full source code which is GPL-licensed. It's free even for commercial usage
    (technical support and customization services can be ordered separately).
</p>
<p>
    TightVNC 2.0 Beta 1 delivers completely new TightVNC Server for Windows. It was redesigned
    and reimplemented from scratch. It features new component-based architecture compatible with
    the latest operating systems, Windows 7 and Windows 2008 Server R2. Older versions of
    Windows are supported as well – the minimum requirement is Windows 2000.
</p>
<p>
    New version introduces a number of major improvements, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>new file transfer subsystem with recursive operations, on-the-fly compression and large
        file support,
    </li>
    <li>solid service-mode configuration (no more confusion between "default" and
        "user" settings),
    </li>
    <li>secure control and configuration interface,</li>
    <li>IP-based access control made easily configurable,</li>
    <li>new installer, compact and flexible.</li>
</ul>
