    This page is about obtaining <font color="#007000"><b>free technical support</b></font>. For information on
    commercial
    support services, please visit <a href="support.php">this page</a>.
</p>
<p>
    TightVNC is free software, so it comes with no warranty. Thus, we do not guarantee free
    technical support. However, there is a number of ways to <font color="#007000"><b>get your problems
    solved</b></font>
    without <a href="support.php">subscribing to technical support services</a>. The rest of
    this page describes what to read first and where to ask questions if you need some basic
    technical help.
</p>
<h3>Where to Ask Questions?</h3>
<p>
    <font color="#007000"><b>Short answer:</b></font> in TightVNC mailing lists. <a href="lists.php">See the
    instructions
    here.</a>
</p>
<p>
    Most importantly, <font color="#007000"><b>please do not contact TightVNC staff directly</b></font>. Most likely,
    there
    will be no response. We apologize for the inconvenience, but we have been receiving far too
    much e-mail. Thus, we cannot answer to all individual help requests.
</p>
<p>
    If you have a question, it might be a good idea to <font color="#007000"><b>search for existing answers</b></font>
    first:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>read the list of <a href="faq.php">Frequently Asked Questions</a> (also see the <a target="_blank"
                                                                                           href="http://www.realvnc.com/faq.html">VNC
        FAQ</a>)
    </li>
    <li><a href="lists.php">browse or search TightVNC mailing lists (see Searching List
        Archives)</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.realvnc.com/swish-e/search2/vnc-list">search VNC
        mailing list</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">search the Web with Google</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
If that did not help, ask a question in the <font color="#007000"><b>TightVNC mailing list</b></font>. <a
        href="lists.php">Here you can find instructions on using the mailing lists</a>: what lists
are available, how to subscribe or unsubscribe, where to post messages to, and how to browse
and search the archives.
<p></p>
<h3>Subscribe to Announcements</h3>
<p>
    You can be easily notified when <font color="#007000"><b>new releases</b></font> of TightVNC are available. To start
    receiving announcements, subscribe to the TightVNC-Announce mailing list (low traffic). <a href="lists.php">See the
    instructions here.</a> Note that all the announcements are also
    copied to the general TightVNC mailing list (see above), so normally you don't have to
    subscribe to both lists.
