<h3>What Windows versions does TightVNC support?</h3>
<p>
    TightVNC runs basically on any version of Windows
    (both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10,</li>
    <li>corresponding versions of Windows Server.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
    On Windows XP, you should have the latest Service Pack installed. Windows CE systems are not
    supported.
</p>
<p>
    There are no minimum disk space or RAM requirements. TightVNC uses so little space and memory
    that it can run anywhere Windows is running.
</p>
<p>
    Previous TightVNC version 1.2 and 1.3 have some limitations, however.
    It is not possible to use TightVNC Server as a system service on Windows Vista / Windows 7 in this case.

<h3>How would I connect from the Internet to a machine in the internal network which is behind a router?</h3>
<p>
    You should enable "port forwarding" in your router's configuration. Port forwarding
    allows passing external connections to computers in the internal network. Almost all routers
    support this type of redirection.
</p>
<p>
    For example, to access VNC or TightVNC server running on default ports, a router can be
    configured such way that TCP connections to ports 5900 and 5800 would be passed to the same
    ports of a particular machine with a specified private IP address (typically 192.168.x.x).
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example of configuring port forwarding, assuming that TightVNC Server is running
    on default ports 5900 and 5800, on the machine with IP 192.168.1.100:
</p>
<table width="100%" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5" border="0">
    <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
        <th>Application</th>
        <th>Start<br>Port</th>
        <th>End<br>Port</th>
        <th>Protocol</th>
        <th>IP Address</th>
        <th>Enable</th>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#F4F4F4" align="center">
        <td>TightVNC</td>
        <td>5900</td>
        <td>5900</td>
        <td>TCP</td>
        <td>192.168.1.100</td>
        <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#F4F4F4" align="center">
        <td>TightVNC</td>
        <td>5800</td>
        <td>5800</td>
        <td>TCP</td>
        <td>192.168.1.100</td>
        <td>yes</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    When port forwarding is set up, you can connect to the router's IP address such way as
    if it was your target machine's IP address, but you should specify those port numbers on
    which port forwarding was activated.

<h3>How secure is TightVNC?</h3>
<p>
    Although TightVNC encrypts VNC passwords sent over the net, the rest of the traffic is sent
    as is, unencrypted (for password encryption, VNC uses a DES-encrypted challenge-response
    scheme, where the password is limited by 8 characters, and the effective DES key length is 56
    bits). So using TightVNC over the Internet can be a security risk. To solve this problem, we
    have plans to implement built-in encryption in future versions of TightVNC.
</p>
<p>
    In the mean time, if you need <i>real</i> security, we recommend installing an SSH server,
    and using SSH tunneling for all TightVNC connections from untrusted networks.

<h3>How can I hide the tray icon of my TightVNC Server?</h3>
<p>
</p><h4>Answer for TightVNC versions 1.x:</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    To disable the tray icon, you should start the "regedit" utility from the
    command line, go to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ORL\WinVNC3\ folder, and create
    a DWORD parameter with the name "DisableTrayIcon" and the value "1".
    Then, after restarting TightVNC Server, the icon will not be shown anymore.
</p>
<p>
    But please note that hiding the icon is usually not a good idea. For example, if you want to
    restrict users from changing the server Properties, it might be better to use the
    AllowProperties setting. For more information, see the description of
    "AllowProperties", "AllowShutdown" and "AllowEditClients"
    options in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/3.3.7/winvnc.html">VNC
    documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p><h4>Answer for TightVNC versions 2.x:</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    Open TightVNC configuration, choose Server tab, uncheck "Show icon in the notification area",
    press Ok.
</p>
<p>
    To show the icon again, use one of Control Interface or Offline Configuration shortcuts found
    under the TightVNC group under Start\All Programs.

<h3>Does TightVNC work on Mac OS X?</h3>
<p>
    Currently, we do not offer a version for Mac OS X. It's very likely that TightVNC will
    include one in the future, but not in the nearest days. Currently, our team is busy working
    on the Windows version.
</p>
<p>
    If you need viewer part on Mac OS X, try TightVNC Java Viewer. It's cross-platform and
    should work fine in any system where Java environment can be installed, including MacOS X.
</p>
<p>
    Also note that recent versions of Mac OS X include built-in VNC-compatible server which is
    compatible with TightVNC as well. In other words, you can connect to any modern Mac OS X
    system with TightVNC Viewer.

<h3>How do I uninstall TightVNC?</h3>
<p>
    Normally, TightVNC can be removed just like any other software, from the Control Panel
    (Add/Remove Programs). But if something goes wrong, or TightVNC was installed manually, you
    can always remove it manually using step-by-step procedures below.
</p>
<h4>Uninstall procedure for TightVNC versions 1.x:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Log in as an Administrator (or as a user with similar permissions).</li>
    <li>If TightVNC Server is running, close it. If it is running but not showing the tray icon,
        choose Process Manages, locate WinVNC.exe process and shutdown it.
    </li>
    <li>If TightVNC Server was registered as a system service, unregister it. To do that, locate
        WinVNC.exe file under \Program Files\TightVNC (or wherever TightVNC was installed), and type
        in the command line: WinVNC.exe -remove
    </li>
    <li>Remove the whole \Program Files\TightVNC directory (or wherever TightVNC was
        installed).
    </li>
    <li>Remove all TightVNC shortcuts from the Start\All Programs menu.</li>
    <li>Remove the settings from the registry if desired. The settings can be found in
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ORL and/or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ORL.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>Uninstall procedure for TightVNC versions 2.x:</h4>
<ol>
