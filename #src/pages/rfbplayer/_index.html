<h3>What Is It?</h3>
<p>
    RfbPlayer is a program able to replay saved VNC sessions. Strictly speaking, it plays back
    RFB sessions – RFB is a protocol used in VNC and TightVNC.
</p>
<p>
    RfbPlayer is written in Java. Just like the TightVNC Java Viewer, it can be used either as a
    Web-embedded <font color="#007000"><b>applet</b></font> or as a standalone <font color="#007000"><b>applicaion</b></font>. When used as an applet,
    RfbPlayer can load session files from the Web site. It allows showing demonstrations to the
    Web site visitors who just enjoy playback in their browsers and do not have to download or
    install anything to their computers.
</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
    There is no comprehensive documentation on RfbPlayer. Below on this page, you can find a brief
    help on recording sessions and running the player. Also, there is a small README file found in
    the distribution. For more details, please read the source code. Note that RfbPlayer is free
    software and it's available as is, with no warranty and no free support.

<h3>Running RfbPlayer</h3>
<p>
    Running as an application (from the command line):
</p>
<blockquote class="rfbplayer-page-blockquote"><tt>
    java -jar RfbPlayer.jar URL file:test.fbs<br>
    java -jar RfbPlayer.jar URL http://remote.host/test.fbs
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
    And example of running it as an applet (HTML code):
</p>
<blockquote class="rfbplayer-page-blockquote"><tt>
    &lt;APPLET ARCHIVE="RfbPlayer.jar"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;CODE="RfbPlayer.class"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="632"&gt;<br>
    &lt;PARAM NAME="URL" VALUE="http://remote.host/test.fbs"&gt;
</tt></blockquote>
<h3>Recording VNC Sessions</h3>
<p>
    There is a number of programs that can record VNC sessions and save them in the FBS
    (FrameBuffer Stream) format.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000"><b>TightVNC Java Viewer</b></font>, versions prior to 2.0. It can save sessions when run as a
        standalone application (not an applet). TightVNC Java Viewer is available from the <a href="download-old.php">download page (versions 1.3)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vnc-reflector/">VNC
        Reflector</a>. It acts as a proxy running between servers and viewers, and it can save screen
        data received from the server. It always uses 24-bit color in saved sessions. It's a
        Unix-style program (although there is a Cygwin port for Windows available) and it's free
        (BSD-type license).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://cyberelk.net/tim/rfbproxy/">rfbproxy</a>
        utility. It's a simple program designed for Unix which can both save and replay saved
        VNC sessions. In the record mode, it sits between a server and a viewer, and simply records
        all the data received from the server. It's free software (GPL-licensed).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    File formats are basically compatible between these programs (especially if 24-bit color
    format is used for recording).
