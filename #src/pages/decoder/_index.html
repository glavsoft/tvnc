    This document describes Tight Decoder which is commercially available from the TightVNC
    developers.

<h3>Who Can Benefit?</h3>
<p>
    This page is addressed to authors and copyright holders of <font color="#007000"><b>VNC-compatible client
    software</b></font>.
    If you sell a sort of VNC-capable viewer for some device, or distribute such a
    remote control client as a part of your bigger software product, you might be interested in
    adding our Tight Decoder to your software. If that is the case, please read this entire page.
</p>
<h3>What is Tight Decoder?</h3>
<p>
    The RFB protocol as used in VNC and TightVNC defines "encodings" as
    algorithms/formats used to encode graphics (pixel data). TightVNC uses its own
    highly-efficient method of compressing graphics optimized for low bandwidth. It's called
    "<font color="#007000"><b>Tight encoding</b></font>". Tight encoding includes both efficient "lossless"
    compression and optional "lossy" JPEG compression.
</p>
<p>
    We offer a separate <font color="#007000"><b>Tight Decoder</b></font> written in pure C. It can be useful if you
    already
    have a proprietary VNC-compatible client which does not support Tight/JPEG encodings and you
    would like to add such support. It's a pure C library, very easy to use and integrate
    into any <font color="#007000"><b>C or C++</b></font> program.
</p>
<h3>Why It's Important to Support Tight Encoding?</h3>
<p>
    Currently, there are only two free VNC-compatible servers available that can work correctly
    in modern Windows systems. That's <font color="#007000"><b>TightVNC and UltraVNC</b></font>. Unfortunately, the
    original free version of VNC does not work in Windows Vista or Windows 7, and even does not
    support Fast User Switching feature of Windows XP.
</p>
<p>
    And both TightVNC and UltraVNC support Tight encoding. In other words, <font color="#007000"><b>ALL</b></font> free
    VNC-compatible servers apt to work under modern Windows systems do support Tight encoding. If
    your viewer does not support it yet, it may operate inefficiently, or sometimes very
    inefficiently, when connected to such servers. Probably your users will notice that.
</p>
<p>
    And the fix is simple — purchase our <font color="#007000"><b>proven implementation</b></font> of Tight Decoder and
    integrate it into your software (we made special efforts to make this part as easy as
    possible). Tight Decoder was authored by Constantin Kaplinsky who as well is the creator of
    the Tight encoding itself, so this can be considered the original reference implementation.

<h3>What Are the License Terms?</h3>
<p>
    What we offer is a <font color="#007000"><b>perpetual</b></font> non-exclusive license to the <font color="#007000"><b>complete
    source code</b></font> of
    Tight Decoder. It costs 800 U.S. dollars. This price is quite reasonable — writing your
    own analog of Tight Decoder would be many times more expensive and also would take
    significant amount of time which could be spent much better.
</p>
<p>
    Note that you purchase a license once and forever. No expiration dates, no per-copy
    royalties, no limitations on the number of products or devices. Please see more details on
    the license terms in the Annex 2, below.

<h3>Annex 1: The Technical Point of View</h3>
<p>
    Below you can see a simplified example of using the decoder. The example does not deal with
    initialization and cleanup, memory allocation or error handling, it just demonstrates the
    basic idea of using the decoder. Here it how that looks like:
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;tight-decoder.h&gt;
...

{
  TIGHT_DECODER decoder;   /* structure maintaining the state of the decoder */
  char buf[BIG_NUMBER];    /* in real programs, don't use fixed-size buffers */
  int num_bytes;
  ...

    /* For each rectangle: */
    num_bytes = tight_decode_start(&amp;decoder, x, y, width, height);
    while (num_bytes &gt; 0) {
      ...
      /* Read num_bytes to buf[] here. */
      ...
      num_bytes = tight_decode_continue(&amp;decoder, buf);
    }
    if (num_bytes &lt; 0) {
      /* Handle errors. */
    }
    /* Rectangle has been decoded successfully. */

  ...</pre>
<p>
    As you can see from the example, you should call <font color="#007000"><b>tight_decode_start()</b></font> in the
    beginning
    of each rectagle. Then call <font color="#007000"><b>tight_decode_continue()</b></font> repeatedly until that
    rectangle is
    finished. Both functions return the number of bytes you should read into a buffer prior to
    calling tight_decode_continue() next time. If that number of bytes is zero, the rectangle
    decoding has been completed successfully. On errors, -1 will be returned.
</p>
<p>
    Simple, is not it? ;)
