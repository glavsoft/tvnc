    This page provides information on the Remote Core SDK for the .NET framework. Remote Core SDK
    as a <font color="#007000"><b>remote desktop client in your software</b></font>. It's fully TightVNC-compatible,
    since
    it's developed by GlavSoft LLC, creators of TightVNC software.
</p>
<h3>About Remote Core SDK and its .NET Version</h3>
<p>
    Remote Core SDK is a Software Development Kit, a set of libraries that implement TightVNC
    Viewer functions, and hide all the complexity of TightVNC protocols behind a simple and
    convenient Application Programming Interface (API).
</p>
<p>
    Remote Core SDK is a product family. It has versions for various platforms, operating systems
    and frameworks: Windows, macOS, Unix/Linux/X11, iOS, Android, Java VM, .NET framework.
</p>
<p>
    .NET Viewer SDK is a part of Remote Core SDK which implements functionality of a TightVNC
    Viewer for the .NET environment. It supports desktop and server versions of Windows systems and
    requires .NET framework versions 3.5 and above (although at least 4.0 is strongly recommended).
    It can be used in both WinForms and WPF applications, and it even can be used without GUI at
    all if necessary. However, the easiest way to use the SDK is to integrate its high-level WPF or
    WinForms components that implement remote desktop and handle most of the work automatically.
