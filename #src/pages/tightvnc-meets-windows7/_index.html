<h3 align="center">TightVNC meets Windows 7</h3>
<p>
    On February 17, 2010, new version of TightVNC Server has <font color="#007000"><b>passed final testing on Windows
    7</b></font>.
    It was tested in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and worked as expected in all cases.
</p>
<p>
    TightVNC, a free remote control package, was often referred to as one of the best in its
    field. However, there were notable drawbacks. It was not fully compatible with Windows
    Vista and Windows 7. In particular, the server component could not be used as a "system
    service" so it did not allow to control a remote computer where nobody was logged in.
</p>
<p>
    Now that's becoming history. The <font color="#007000"><b>upcoming version 2.0</b></font> of the TightVNC Server
    will
    work as a service in all modern Windows operating systems. And, unlike version 1.3, it will
    work just fine with Fast User Switching feature of Windows XP.
</p>
<p>
    Besides that, new version will introduce a number of <font color="#007000"><b>other major improvements</b></font>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>new file transfer subsystem based on new protocol extensions,</li>
    <li>easily configurable IP-based access control for incoming connections,</li>
    <li>no more confusion between "default" and "user" configuration
        sets,
    </li>
    <li>new administrative interface optionally protected with a password.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The first Beta version of TightVNC 2.0 will be publicly released on
    <font color="#007000"><b>February 23, 2010</b></font>.
