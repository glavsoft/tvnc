<h3>The Default License: GNU GPL</h3>
<p>
    TightVNC is available under the terms of the <a target="_blank"
                                                    href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU
    General Public License</a>
    (usually referred to as GPL). This is the <font color="#007000"><b>primary type of licensing</b></font>, you do not
    have to
    pay for it or enter into any special agreement. Just download the software and use it for any
    legally allowed purposes, including commercial use. Also, you may redistribute verbatim
    copies of the software with no limitations (unless such distribution is restricted by local
    or international laws). You even may modify the software and distribute its modified copies,
    provided that all your modifications are GPL-licensed as well.
</p>
<h3>GPL Restrictions</h3>
<p>
    While GPL is usually a good option for end users of the software, it may not be that good for
    commercial software developers. <font color="#007000"><b>GPL does not allow</b></font> you to link GPL-licensed
    components
    with your proprietary software (without publishing it under the GPL as well). Also,
    <font color="#007000"><b>it does not allow</b></font> you to modify the GPL code and make the changes proprietary.
    Thus,
    you cannot use GPL code in your non-GPL projects (unless the GPL code is properly separated).
</p>
<h3>Business-Friendly Licensing</h3>
<p>
    To solve the described problems, we offer alternate business-friendly licensing options. If
    you wish to <font color="#007000"><b>integrate TightVNC</b></font> into your commercial software package and GPL is
    not an
    acceptable option, you should obtain a commercial license.
</p>
