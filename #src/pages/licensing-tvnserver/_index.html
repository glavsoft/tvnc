    This page describes commercial-friendly licensing option for <font color="#007000"><b>TightVNC Server</b></font>
    version 2
    for Windows.
</p>
<p>
    <font color="#007000"><b>Important note:</b></font> If all you need is to use TightVNC AS IS, then it's
    <font color="#007000"><b>100% free</b></font>! Yes, TightVNC is freely available under the terms of the GNU GPL
    license.
</p>
<h3>If It's Free, Why Purchase a License?</h3>
<p>
    Let's consider you would like to <font color="#007000"><b>have TightVNC functionality in your own
    software</b></font>.
    For example, you plan to add desktop sharing to your conference system. If your
    project is not free software, you are not allowed to sell TightVNC as a part of your
    closed-source system. The GPL simply does not permit that.
</p>
<p>
    This is where <font color="#007000"><b>we can help you</b></font> by providing a commercial license to our source
    code.
</p>
<h3>What Are the Benefits?</h3>
<p>
    In short, you can <font color="#007000"><b>save both time and money</b></font>.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of creating remote desktop software from the scratch (that's many man-months of
    development and many serious risks), use our existing production-ready code as a base.
    It's many times less expensive than the development from the scratch would take!
</p>
<p>
    Also, the license is <font color="#007000"><b>available immediately</b></font> while the development can take months
    or
    years. For example, it took us more than two years to develop TightVNC Server 2.0 from the
    scratch! You can save that time by simply purchasing the source code license.
</p>
<h3>How Much Does It Cost? What Are the License Terms?</h3>
<p>
    What we offer is a <font color="#007000"><b>perpetual</b></font> non-exclusive license to the <font color="#007000"><b>complete
    source code</b></font> of
    TightVNC Server version 2 for Windows. Note that you purchase a license once and forever. No
    expiration dates, no per-copy royalties, no limitations on the number of products or devices.
