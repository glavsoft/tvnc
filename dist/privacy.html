<h3>Cookies and Website Analytics</h3>
<p>
    To improve your experience on our site, we may use “cookies”. Cookies are an
    industry standard and most major web sites use them. A cookie is a small text file that our
    site may place on your computer as a tool to remember your preferences. You may refuse the use
    of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if
    you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
</p>
<p>
    Cookies are used for two particular purposes on our site: (1) to enable Google Analytics, and
    (2) to remember that you were informed about cookies on our website, so that we would not have
    to show cookie-related warnings repeatedly, each time you open any of our webpages.
</p>
<p>
    Google Analytics is a service which allows us to analyse usage of our website. It transmits
    website traffic statistics to Google servers. Google Analytics does not identify individual
    users or associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. We use reports provided
    by Google Analytics to understand website traffic and webpage usage. Google Analytics cannot
    work without using cookies.
</p>
<p>
    By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner
    described in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google's
    Privacy Policy</a> and for the purposes set out above. You can opt out of Google Analytics if
    you disable or refuse corresponding cookies, disable JavaScript, or <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">use the opt-out service provided by Google</a>.

<h3>Social Media</h3>
<p>
    If you share our content through social media, for example by liking us on Facebook, following
    or tweeting about us on Twitter, or giving us a “+1” via Google Plus, those social
    networks will record that you have done so and may set a cookie for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
    In some cases, where a page on our website includes content from a social network, such as a
    Twitter feed, or Facebook comments box, those services may set a cookie even where you do not
    click a button. As is the case for all cookies, we cannot access those set by social networks,
    just as those social networks cannot access cookies we set ourselves.
</p>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>
    Similarly to almost all other websites, our systems automatically gather anonymous information
    about visitors of the website, including IP addresses, browser types, languages, the times and
    dates of webpage visits, general locations as determined from IP addresses and provided by the
    browser, the sites from which visitors come.
</p>
<p>
    The data collected does not include personally identifiable information and may be used for
    statistical analysis, to understand user behaviour, and to administer the site. This
    information is removed automatically after fixed period of time (not exceeding two months) as
    specified in the configuration of the web server software used to host our website.
</p>
<h3>Disclosing to Third Parties</h3>
<p>
    Your information will not be disclosed to any third party unless you have given your consent to
    such disclosure, or that's a part of the agreement or contract between you and our company.
</p>
<h3>Sale of Business</h3>
<p>
    In a special case, if our business is sold or integrated with another business, your details
    may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers, and will be
    passed on to the new owners of the business. The information will be disclosed only to the
    extent required for business sale procedures, and will be protected by non-disclosure
    agreements with all parties involved.
</p>
<h3>Control Your Information</h3>
<p>
    You have the right to know what personal information we are holding on you. Also, you may ask
    us to correct or change your information, or choose to remove its particular parts, or delete
    all your information completely. In any of these cases, please send us an email requesting the
    action desired. Please see our email addresses on the <a href="https://www.tightvnc.com/contact.php">“Contact
    Us” page on our web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that if you use any of our products or services which require you to provide
    personal information, deleting our records may mean that you will need to resubmit it to
    continue using such products or services.
