                <h3>TightVNC 2.8.59</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed remote desktop updating problems with -sharedisplay and -sharerect options. If the shared area was changed
        but its size remained the same, update did not happen.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Details in EXE and DLL file properties have been updated. This does not affect functionality in any way (sf bug
        #1539).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.57 (limited distribution release)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a bug arising on certain video hardware configurations that might cause the server to crash on accepting
        new connections (sf bug #1535).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem with restoring custom wallpaper after all viewers disconnect, when using the option "Hide
        desktop wallpaper" (sf bugs #1505, #1100).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Made minor user interface improvements (almost not noticeable to a normal user).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Installer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem with a configuration form shown during installation which could not be closed properly via the
        Task Manager.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.55</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Reverted recent changes in processing keyboard events that caused keyboard-related problems in version 2.8.53
        (sf bugs #1530, #1531, #1532, #1533).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a build problem that caused compatibility problems with certain versions of VNC software, due to using
        wrong protocol extension (sf bug #1534).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Improved text labels and layout of elements in a number of screen forms.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Connecting to RDP sessions is now disabled by default and should be enabled explicitly, as sharing some virtual
        session instead of the main screen is probably not something a user would expect by default.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a minor resource leak (although it did not seem to cause any problems during normal operation).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.53</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Added support for Unicode clipboard transfers (UTF-8). The latest public version of the standard RFB protocol
        (3.8) does not support Unicode text, so we implemented this via a new TightVNC protocol extension. This feature
        will work when supported at both ends of the connection.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Added support for Echo messages to let viewer software check responsiveness of a server. This may be used for
        detecting network failures faster when there is no other traffic between Server and Viewer, and will work only
        with viewers that support and use this new protocol extension. Echo messages will be supported in our latest
        SDKs but normal TightVNC Viewer does not use them yet.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Protection against brute-force attacks has been improved. Previously, the server allowed no more than 10
        authentication failures per 30 seconds from the same IP address. Now the algorithm is more complicated: 1-second
        timeouts after 2 attempts, 1-minute timeouts after 8 attempts, and 1-hour timeouts after 14 attempts. In other
        words, it would allow no more than 38 authentication attempts within 24 hours per one IP address.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Now it's possible to connect to an active RDP session.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Performance has been improved in modern Windows systems (starting with Windows 8). Dragging windows over the
        desktop should render many times faster, due to the added support of CopyRect encoding with Direct3D and Desktop
        Duplication APIs.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Performance of file transfers has been improved. In particular, listing contents of large folders should become
        much faster.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a crash in server running in application mode that could happen when Windows shows UAC (User Account
        Control) pop-up prompts. This problem is specific to reverse server-to-client connections (sf bug #1507).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed clipboard transfers. In certain cases, the server did not send clipboard contents to viewers since it
        wrongly decided there were no clipboard updates for those particular viewers (sf bug #1403).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed crash for large displays, with total resolution over 134 millions of pixels, e.g. 16384 х 8192 and more.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Potentially fixed incorrect handling of mouse cursors on certain Matrox video cards.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a memory leak (rather a potential one which would not show up during normal operation).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Installer for Windows:</font>
        New "ServiceOnly" configuration option has been added, to prevent TightVNC Server from starting in application
        mode.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed AltGr handling for Korean keyboard layout.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.27</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed server crash on changing window size when sharing one particular window with -sharewindow option (sf bug
        #1475).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed problems with generating incorrect symbols with certain national keyboard layouts, e.g. when pressing "3"
        in Turkish layout and "6" in Portugese Brazilian ABNT2 layout (sf bugs #1482, #1458).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed problem with sending black screen when a viewer requests 16-bit or 8-bit colors with big-endian byte order
        (sf bug #1473).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed an issue with mouse cursor jumping to the top left corner of the screen on requesting full screen update.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Added support of Romanian diacritical marks.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem of adding extra null character when transferring text data from clipboard (sf bug #1485).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed incorrect handling of the -mousecursor command-line option (sf bug #1457).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.23</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Implemented an adaptive algorithm for improving image quality by re-transmitting static screen areas using
        lossless compression.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Added option to disable screen reading through Direct3D API.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed lockup after execution of the command -controlservice –sharewindow.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed slowdown while copying screen data through Direct3D API in multi-monitor configurations.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed slowdown while searching video windows by a class name.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a descriptor leak (low severity).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed incorrect character transmission in Swedish keyboard layout.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Added new -logpath command line option.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.11</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Implemented performance improvements that may notably increase update speed and optimize CPU usage.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem that might cause the viewer to continue sending keyboard events even after minimizing a
        full-screen window (sf bug #1433).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed an incorrect calculation in keyboard handling, which unlikely caused any problems though (sf bug #1422).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Source Code for Windows (Server and Viewer):</font>
        Migrated to Visual Studio 2015 and MSBuild tool set as the primary build environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.8</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Installer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem which caused errors in handling installation parameters (sf bug #1408).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.7 (limited release)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed the bug causing the "Connection has been gracefully closed" problem (sf bug #1386).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.6 (limited release)</h3>

        Windows 7 computers.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a bug that could make the server crash after a client has disconnected.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Source Code for Windows (Server and Viewer):</font>
        Changed output directory structure in internal build scripts (the changes do not affect distribution packages).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.3 (limited release)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed server crash on Windows 7 introduced in version 2.8.2.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Fixed a problem when the viewer did not start in applet mode (sf bug #1390).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.8.2</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Added support for "IdleTimeout" registry key which specifies how many seconds to wait for mouse or keyboard
        events. If there was no activity from a client during the specified timeout, the corresponding client will be
        disconnected. The value 0 (DWORD) stands for no timeout at all (stay connected forever), and that's the default
        setting. This setting is not configurable from the user interface.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Improved handling for screen orientation changes.

</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem with the Alt key becoming stuck in the pressed state after Alt-Tab switching in Windows 8 (sf
        bugs #1341, #1311, #1303, #1302).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed built-in HTTP server crash on Windows XP and Windows 7 when the request URL includes parameters (sf bug
        #1344).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a rare problem triggered when a server shares one display in multi-monitor configuration, with more than
        one viewer connected. If a user on the server changed the focus to other display, the viewers could see the
        active windows from the other display on top of the shared display and everything became messy.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed server-side clipboard handling. After receiving clipboard contents from a client, the server could return
        the same clipboard data back to the same client, and clipboard could be damaged on the viewer side (sf bug
        #1255).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a bug with deleting random characters from the host:port string. The bug was caused by incorrect
        calculation of the number of Unicode characters (sf bug #1349).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed problems with Shift, Alt and Ctrl keys getting locked in the pressed state on switching from the viewer
        window to other applications (sf bugs #1360, #1329, #1174).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem which prevented from connecting to a Dispatcher using big ID numbers (ID &gt;= 2147483648).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        A typo has been fixed in the warning window shown on entering the full-screen mode (sf bug #1270).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Removed libjpeg-turbo library in favor of the standard libjpeg. The accelerated library did not show major
        performance improvements in typical situations but introduced questionable requirements on the hardware and the
        compiler. The codebase goes cross-platform, so we chose to get rid of such dependencies.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Added new -showConnectionDialog command-line option. Set to "No" if you do not want to show initial connection
        dialog. Default: "Yes".
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Fixed an issue that resulted in error message "Value too long" (sf bug #1379).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Increased Java compatibility requirement, now it requires Java 1.7 (previous versions required Java 1.6).
    </li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Added an option to specify a list of rectangles to be treated as video and sent to viewers with minimal delays.
        Rectangles are specified by their screen coordinates in the Video tab in the TightVNC Server's Configuration
        window. Normally, this option is not very useful, it's rather for using TightVNC in specialized environments.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        When sharing just one application (-shareapp command-line option), do not pass remote keyboard input to other
        apps.

        servers not directly accessible from the Internet). Dispatcher is available separately, under commercial
        licenses only.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Switched to a different library for supporting SSH tunneling (now using Trilead SSH-2 instead of JSch).

        Now Viewer can successfully connect to servers that require RFB protocol 4.0 or higher (in fact, RFB 3.8 will be
        used to establish connection).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        If minimized, a full-screen window is now restored as a full-screen application rather than a windowed one.

    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed Ctrl and Alt key handling. Sometimes the state of Ctrl and Alt buttons on the viewer toolbar did not
        correspond to the actual state of the hardware keys.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Source Code (Viewer for Windows):</font>
        Refactoring of the viewer-core API for future protocol extensions (e.g. new message types, authentication
        methods).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Source Code (Viewer for Windows):</font>
        Changed CoreEventsAdapter interface in viewer-core.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.5.2</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Introducing new full-screen mode, with optional auto-scaling, auto-scrolling and a pop-up toolbar.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Installer for Windows:</font>
        Added new MSI installer properties, to automate pre-setting passwords in silent mode.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem with querying local users on incoming connections. TightVNC has a feature to let local user
        approve or reject incoming connections. If there was no user action within a pre-configured time limit, new
        connection will be either accepted or rejected automatically. Unfortunately, the timeout setting did not work
        correctly in previous version and that could result in infinite timeouts. That has been fixed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed the Apply button in the Configuration window - it stayed disabled on editing configuration settings.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed authentication handling in RFB protocol version 3.7. This should resolve connectivity problems with Ubuntu
        systems and Vino servers.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed hang-up on changing language or keyboard layout. To fix this problem, Windows message handling has been
        re-designed completely.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed priority of preferred encodings. Previous version could work inefficiently with servers that do not
        support Tight encoding, because the Viewer could choose uncompressed Raw encoding instead of well-compressed
        ZRLE.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Eliminated 34-character limit on hostnames in the New Connection window.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Using correct line ending characters in cross-platform clipboard transfers.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Introduced a number of improvements and fixes in the user interface. That includes new commands in the toolbar
        and in the system menu, and architectural changes such as restoring the option to start new connections from the
        same Viewer instance.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Adjusting viewer window size on remote desktop resizing.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Other minor improvements and fixes.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Source Code (Server and Viewer for Windows):</font>
        Improved logging architecture. The changes will not be visible to end user, but developers will appreciate new
        logging system. There should be no more static methods and global log objects, so it will be easier to reuse
        separate components in third-party applications. Now all components work via a simple logging interface or can
        work without logging at all.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Source Code (Server and Viewer for Windows):</font>
        Corrected build problems in various combinations of build configurations and platforms, in both Visual Studio
        2008 and Visual Studio 2010.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.5.1</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Installer for Windows:</font>
        Proper viewer binary is now included in the 64-bit installer. In the previous version, 32-bit viewer was
        included by mistake.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Installer for Windows:</font>
        A few text labels and warning messages have been corrected.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a bug with uninitialized memory which could lead to random crashes.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        "Entering full screen" warning now includes an option for not showing it next time.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem with -optionsfile command-line option not working correctly unless full path was provided with
        the options file. Also, error reporting have been improved when using -optionsfile.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Initial image of the remote desktop did not always render correctly in full screen. Now that should be fixed.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.5.0</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Installer for Windows:</font>
        Parameter-based silent installation. You can pre-configure TightVNC Server via MSI parameters and perform mass
        installation via a batch file or Group Policy.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Installer for Windows:</font>
        Both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions of the installer are available.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Full support for 64-bit systems. Besides obvious benefits of using native architecture, this allows to attach so
        called "message hooks" to 64-bit applications. In a simple language, message hooks help at detecting screen
        activity, so that we can get updates almost immediately instead of polling the complete screen once per second
        or so.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Support for mirror video driver (DFMirage). This makes screen reading ultra-fast in all supported versions of
        Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 7. DFMirage driver is a separate product, but it's free for TightVNC users
        (and it's available commercially if needed).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Improved performance when sharing a desktop with Windows Aero enabled. With Aero, each screen reading operation
        is expensive, and we can improve performance by reading more pixels in less operations.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Improved logging. Most importantly, new version reports all incoming connections to Windows Event Log. Also,
        logging to text files has been improved - the service writes to the same log file from all its child processes.
        There's always just one log file, so it's easier to locate an error message or e-mail the log to technical
        support service.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        New option to configure extra ports mapped to arbitrary screen areas. If a client connects to such an extra
        port, it will be shown the corresponding part of the screen only.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        New command-line options to share full desktop, primary monitor, selected monitor, a window, or an arbitrary
        rectangular area.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Optimized video processing for specific window classes. You can tell TightVNC to treat certain windows as video
        by providing a list of window class names. Once a matching window is detected, its contents will be sent to
        clients continuously, with minimum delays.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Completely rewritten version, free of GPL-only source code.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Native 64-bit version for improved performance in x64 systems.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fast screen drawing and optimized decoders.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        New ZRLE decoder for improved compatibility with wide range of VNC-compatible servers.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Desktop scaling that can be easily controlled via the toolbar.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        New feature to pause screen updates. You can freeze the remote desktop at any moment, e.g. to make a screenshot,
        examine details or demonstrate the screen to other people.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Unicode-enabled compilation. Unlike previous versions of TightVNC Viewer, this one fully supports Unicode and
        has no problems with using multiple national languages in user input, screen labels, file names etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Easily reusable source code. The viewer has been redesigned from the scratch. The primary design goal was to
        develop a "remote control SDK" and build the viewer on top of it. And we've done just that. So not only we
        provide new version of the viewer, but we also give software developers an easy way to add remote control
        functionality to their products (both free and commercial). The resulting SDK has a simple interface which hides
        all the complexity of the underlying protocols. It's written in C++, has minimum dependencies on Windows systems
        and will be made truly cross-platform in its future versions.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Desktop scaling that can be easily controlled via the toolbar.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.1 (Java Viewer only)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Added support for various color modes. You can restrict the number of colors to save traffic, or prefer a
        rich-color format to maximize image quality. From the GUI, you can choose a color mode with 8, 64, 256, 65536,
        16777216 colors, or select the server's native number of colors. However, the core component supports any color
        format as allowed by the RFB protocol (except palette-based modes).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Corrected negotiation of the protocol version. There was an error which made TightVNC Java Viewer incompatible
        with Apple Screen Sharing (built-in VNC-compatible server in Mac OS X). New version should be able to connect to
        Mac OS X.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java Viewer:</font>
        Various minor fixes and improvements.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.0.4</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a potential security problem which could allow a logged in user to gain elevated privilegies in file
        transfers. This problem affected Windows 2000 systems only.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        CPU use was significantly reduced in idle periods when there are no users connected.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem which resulted in wrong color rendering in "big-endian" viewers (e.g. PowerPC-based Mac
        viewers).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed rendering of semi-transparent mouse cursors. Previously, big black boxes could be seen instead of such
        cursors.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.0.3</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a bug which prevented file transfers from working properly under Windows 2000.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Introducing new "error handler" which allows saving memory dumps on critical errors.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        In systems with swapped left and right mouse buttons, remote mouse events will be adjusted accordingly. As a
        result, the remote mouse should work just like the local one.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a number of problems led to errors on setting service passwords from the installer.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Not allowing to enter administrative passwords longer than eight characters. This limitation is caused by using
        standard DES-based VNC-compatible authentication. Previous versions used only the first eight characters anyway
        but it was possible to enter longer passwords and that could confuse users who did not know about the
        limitation.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a problem with injecting lowercase characters when CapsLock was on on the server. Previous version
        generated uppercase characters when CapsLock was on, regardless of the Shift state.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Implemented a special trick to bypass the problem with generating "^6" instead of "6" when using US
        International keyboard layout. It looks like there is a bug in Windows so we could do nothing better than to
        cook a workaround specifically for this case.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed clipboard handling with multiple client connections. Previously, clipboard contents might not be sent to
        particular clients in certain circumstances.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Adjusted log verbosity levels for log messages generated by the control interface connection, so that such
        messages will not overload the log any more.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Improved support for simple RFB clients that cannot handle desktop size changes.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Made minor adjustments in the user interface. Specifically, the "About..." form has been cleaned up, and a typo
        has been corrected in the Configuration window.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a number of problems with keyboard handling: preventing modifier keys from being stuck on switching
        to/from the viewer window; distinguishing left and right modifiers properly; sending arbitrary Unicode
        characters even if they were not defined in the original X11 protocol; and sending correct codes for the keys on
        the numeric keypad.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Ctrl-Alt-Del combination should not depend on current ScrollLock state (which normally toggles Alt key to Meta
        key conversion).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed an issue with not sending update requests after choosing Minimize then Maximize on the viewer window (as
        opposed to the Minimize/Restore sequence which always worked correctly).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed a number of problems with saving and restoring connection options.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Fixed user interface logic in the Options window. There were incorrect dependencies between compression-related
        controls.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Improved phrasing for a number of error messages and log records in the file transfer module.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Source Code:</font>
        Visual Studio 2010 is now supported, upgraded solution and project files are included in the source
        distribution. Versions for Visual Studio 2008 are included as well.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.0.2</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        The server could work incorrectly or even crash when font size adjustment or DPI scaling feature was used. New
        version should be fully compatible with Windows desktop scaling. This fix was developed for TightVNC 2.0.1 but
        was not included in that version due to a packaging problem.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>
        More fixes have been made to solve problems with clipboard transfers. Both server and viewer could send question
        characters instead of non-ASCII symbols if current input language did not match the text encoding. These fixes
        complement related changes introduced in version 2.0.1.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.0.1</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        The server could work incorrectly or even crash when font size adjustment or DPI scaling feature was used. New
        version should be fully compatible with Windows desktop scaling. [UPDATE: Due to a packaging problem this fix
        was not included in version 2.0.1.]
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Fixed log file rotation. After creating five backup copies, it failed to rename old files and just overwrote the
        most recent log file.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Server-to-client clipboard transfers have been fixed. Characters beyond the basic ASCII set could be copied into
        the local clipboard incorrectly.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 2.0 (available for Windows only)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Introducing new file transfer subsystem based on new protocol extensions. Multiple files and directories can be
        copied at once, directories are processed recursively. Data compression is used to speed-up copying. Files can
        be renamed or removed, new directories can be created. File sizes are not limited by 4 Gb any more.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Implemented new architecture which separates service code from the user interface. This enables service-mode
        operation under Windows Vista and Windows 7. Also, this fixes all known problems with multi-user features of
        modern Windows systems like Fast User Switching and Terminal Services.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Screen updates have become reliable. If something went wrong and the picture in the viewer is garbled,
        incomplete or outdated, it will be recovered in reasonable time. There should be no more hidden menus or
        destructive window movements. If fast update detection methods fail, full-screen polling will keep updates
        going.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Featuring new secure administrative interface. What was called "TightVNC tray icon" in previous versions is now
        a separate process which acts as a control interface to the TightVNC service. Control interface can be
        optionally protected with a password to make sure users cannot reconfigure or shut down the service unless they
        know the password (or have administrator privileges).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        There should be no more confusion between "default settings" and "user settings". In TightVNC 2.0, there is only
        one service-mode configuration and it is not affected by any per-user settings. The "Configure..." menu item of
        the service always shows the effective configuration. From the other side, TightVNC Server can be started as an
        application, and in that case each user has his/her own configuration.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server for Windows:</font>
        Featuring IP-based access control for incoming connections. Previous versions of TightVNC did allow similar IP
        filtering, but now everything is easily configurable. You can even test the rules on specific IP addresses,
        prior to applying new rules.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Installer:</font>
        TightVNC 2.0 distribution has been packaged with new installer. It's smarter and more efficient. It tries to
        prevent reboots whenever possible. It invites to set passwords so that TightVNC Server would be ready to work
        right at the moment of finishing the installation. From the other side, it can operate silently (when run with
        /S option in the command line). Finally, the complete self-installing TightVNC package (both server and viewer
        parts, and the uninstall tool) is only 550 kilobytes in size.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Server and Viewer for Windows:</font>
        Keyboard handling has been improved. Older versions of TightVNC had problems with passing characters that do not
        fit in the Latin-1 code space. TightVNC 2.0 adds full support for different national codepages and keyboard
        layouts.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>This list of changes is not full. TightVNC Server 2.0 for Windows has been completely rewritten by the TightVNC
        team. It does not include old TightVNC 1.3 code. So the right answer to the "What's New?" question must be
        "Everything!".
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.3.10</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        Impersonating currently logged on user while processing file transfer requests. Disabling file transfers if
        current user is unknown or nobody is logged in.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        Fixed rendering problems when multiple CopyRects were combined with normal updates. That could caused
        distortions that never updated even with full-screen polling active.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        Added new "-silent" command-line option which modifies the behavior of -install, -reinstall and -remove options
        and makes them not show informational windows on successful execution. Note that -silent should precede other
        respective options in the command line.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        LastRect, XCursor and RichCursor pseudo-encodings were not properly enabled if they preceded true encodings in
        the SetEncodings protocol message.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Viewer:</font>
        Fixed integer overflow vulnerabilities reported by Core Security Technologies. A specially modified VNC server
        could currupt the heap of the connected viewer causing its crash or malfunction.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Viewer:</font>
        TightVNC Viewer version 1.3.9 saved only successful connections in the list of recently visited VNC servers. Now
        we save unsuccessful connections too so that users would not ever have to re-type server names after connection
        failures. Also, several other enhancements were made to the code which handles the list of recent connections.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Viewer:</font>
        Fixed a bug with not loading passwords from saved .vnc files correctly if the first byte of their encrypted
        representation was zero.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Viewer:</font>
        Fixed problems under Windows Vista where Windows taskbar could remain visible above the full-screen window.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Viewer:</font>
        Fixed a problem with decoding JPEG rectangles wider than 2048 pixels.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Viewer:</font>
        Fixed a bug with not saving log file name correctly on using the Browse button.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Viewer:</font>
        Usability improvements in the "New Connection" dialog.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Packaging:</font>
        Improved installer and uninstall utility. In this version, self-installing executable will not try to install
        service in Windows Vista. Improved uninstall program always removes the WinVNC service if it was previously
        installed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix Server:</font>
        Applied fixes for 64-bit Linux issues, a patch from Russel Miranda.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix Server:</font>
        Made the vncserver script read configuration from files (system-wide /etc/tightvncserver.conf and user-specific
        $HOME/.vnc/tightvncserver.conf).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">All viewers:</font>
        Allow configuring JPEG quality level regardless of the preferred encoding set. This makes sense because TightVNC
        Servers can transmit video data as JPEG even if Tight is not the preferred encoding.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Fixed a bug that caused NullPointerException when connecting to any VNC server not supporting TightVNC protocol
        extensions.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Fixed a bug with ignoreCursorUpdates option in 24-bit color mode caused the viewer to disconnect. Thanks to
        Damien Mascre for pointing out the issue.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        PORT parameter is not required any more, now it defaults to 5900.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Do not defer update requests by default, to minimize delays in screen updates.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Improvements in reporting statistics on disconnect.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Added debugging parameters (DEBUG_XU, DEBUG_CU) that allow using the viewer as a tool for measuring VNC server
        performance.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other minor improvements and bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.3.9</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">All platforms:</font>
        Added support for the standard RFB protocol version 3.8 with TightVNC extensions.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">All platforms:</font>
        Made "host:port" parsing maximally compatible with VNC4. Interpreting a number in host names like somehost:5900
        as an actual port number if it's not in the range [0..99].
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        Various user interface enhancements - changes in GUI labels, tray icon with a red border when incoming
        connections are not possible for any reason, more information in the tray icon tip, smarter logic in displaying
        the Properties dialog, and more.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        Fixed a problem introduced in TightVNC 1.3.8 - default passwords were not respected if user passwords were not
        set.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        Slightly improved handling of passwords. One of the notable changes is that now it's enough to enter a view-only
        password without providing primary password.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        Fixed problems with running WinVNC service and Terminal Services. When a Remote Desktop (RDP) client connected
        to the console, WinVNC showed black screen and did not restore normal operations even on disconnection of that
        RDP client. Now, we always share the console correctly, and disable simultaneous RDP and VNC sessions. The
        changes were ported from VNC 4.1.2.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        Better way of simulating Ctrl+Alt+Del. There are reports that this solves the problem with greyed username and
        password fields on Windows 2003 Server (bug #887617).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Server:</font>
        Bugfix for the bug #1109102: attempt to restart the machine remotely via TightVNC led to disconnect if there was
        some non-saved data, and further connections were rejected.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Viewer:</font>
        Multiple selection now works in file transfers, thanks to developers at Novell and personally Rohit Kumar.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows Viewer:</font>
        The viewer terminated silently when the server dropped connection right after accepting it. Now we report such
        errors.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Windows version source archive:</font>
        Included project files for compiling with Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition. Also, all required libraries are now
        included within the source distribution.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix Server:</font>
        Applied patches from Debian Linux that port Xvnc to x86_64 platform (tightvnc-1.2.9-amd64support.p and
        tightvnc-1.3_alpha7-x86_64.patch), thanks to Quanah Gibson-Mount.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Implemented scaling, either with a fixed scaling factor or automatic. If Java 2D API is available (Java 1.2 and
        higher), then high-quality scaling is used. From the other side, the viewer remains compatible with Java 1.1
        where it would simply use scaling with much decreased image quality. Scaling can be enabled with new "Scaling
        Factor" parameter but cannot be controlled from the GUI yet.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Added support for ZRLE encoding.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Disabled focus traversal keys under JVMs 1.4 and higher. This fixes the problem with not sending Tab key events
        to the VNC server.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Fixed wrong pixel format interpretation at decoding RichCursor pseudo-encoding (local cursor could be rendered
        in wrong colors).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other improvements and bugfixes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.3.8, release candidate version</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed major problem with disconnecting clients on screen locking, user logoff and logon, in the service mode.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Added support for DFMirage driver direct screen access mode (from DemoForge LLC).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Added support for multiple monitors (from DemoForge LLC).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Improved layout and functionality of the Properties dialog.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        More accurate password handling - now the server code tries to distinguish between "empty" and "unset" passwords
        better.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        New -shareall, -shareprimary and -sharearea command-line options, working similarly to the -sharewindow option.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed problems with restoring desktop wallpaper.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        Fixed bug with not enabling JPEG compression by default.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        Fixed bug with not setting proper size of the viewer window.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix server:</font>
        Port numbers are now calculated modulo 65536 with vncviewer's -listen option. That makes it possible to listen
        on TCP ports under 5900.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Automatic encoding selection based on measuring current network throughput.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other improvements and bugfixes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.3dev7, release candidate version</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed the problem with "olemainthreadwndname not responding" in service mode under Windows NT 4.0. Under that
        OS, the TightVNC service could hang on logoff.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Removed the code for "desktop optimizations" that was rather harmful than useful. Hopefully, this should fix
        problems with crashing Delphi applications. Also this should prevent settings like font smoothing always set to
        true on disconnect.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed the issue with port number edit boxes that were labeled incorrectly in the Properties dialog.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Disallowing clipboard transfers in view-only mode.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed the problem with carriage return/linefeed conversion of clipboard data.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed the problem with wallpaper being removed only after completing the initial screen transmission.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Minor improvements in the File Transfers dialog.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        More context help messages in Properties and File Transfers dialogs.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix server:</font>
        Fixed a serious bug with sending cursor updates when there was no FrameBufferUpdateRequest from that client.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix server:</font>
        Fixed problems with building Xvnc on modern linux distributions, such as Fedora Core 3.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix server:</font>
        Disallowing clipboard transfers for view-only clients.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other improvements and bugfixes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.3dev6, Win32 release candidate version</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Improved layout of the Properties dialog, added context help for every option. Also, current mirror driver
        status is shown in the Hooks tab.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Implemented new checkbox "Enable applet params in URLs" corresponding to EnableURLParams registry setting.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        The option "Don't use mirror display driver even if available" is now functional.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        New option "Blank screen on client connections". When set and new client connects, the server's monitor is
        forced to go to power saving mode.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed bugs with saving certain settings in the registry, and bugs with setting default values when the registry
        is not writable.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed a problem with one-pixel mouse offset.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed problems with inter-thread locking, this should solve "Unhandled message type received" problems.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed a problem with the setting "Block remote input on local activity", it was not working with DLL hooks
        disabled.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed various problems with file transfer implementation. Error handling was improved, the C: drive bug under
        Win98/Me seems to be solved.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        New "Auto" scaling mode. In this mode, the viewer scales remote desktop to fit local window or screen size. If
        the window size is changed, the scaling factor is adjusted automatically.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        Now the viewer checks server's capabilities and does not ever use non-standard protocol messages not supported
        by the server. This change affects file transfers only, as other features do not use non-standard protocol
        messages..
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        New "scale remote cursor" option has been added. It allows to reduce or enlarge cursor image in the full-control
        mode.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        A cursor repaint problem has been fixed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other improvements and bugfixes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.3dev5, development version</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Support for the "DFMirage" mirror video driver has been added (the driver itself will be available separately).
        Using the mirror driver greatly increases the speed and reliability of updates, and also desreases CPU
        utilization on the server.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        New polling algorithm has been implemented. It's similar to that found in x0rfbserver. New algorithm uses
        minimum CPU time when there are no changes on the screen, and detects major changes very quickly, resulting in
        greatly improved responsiveness on the client side.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Improved methods for filtering screen changes that actually do not change anything. New algorithm not only works
        faster, but it also detects changes much more accurately, leaving less work to encoders.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        A special mode for Unix users has been implemented: when ScrollLock is on, the viewer will send Meta on pressing
        Alt keys.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed a problem with view-only clients that were enabled full control on just opening the Properties dialog of
        the server.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        It should not ever hang any more on changing ports or the LoopbackOnly setting.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        DisableTrayIcon and RemoveWallpaper settings are working again.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        The problem with not saving Query Settings has been fixed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        The polling mode "on event received only" has been fixed - it did not work correctly in previous version.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Fixed a number of issues with mouse handling, including that annoying problem with pointer jumping on slow
        connections.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        Applied a bugfix from HorizonLive solving the problem with crashes or incorrect operation after color depth
        changes on the server's desktop.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        It does not crash any more on entering long passwords in the authentication window.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        Positioning and resizing logic of the viewer window has been improved.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        Now the viewer chooses more reasonable file names for saved .vnc sessions.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        In the full-screen mode, the viewer allows other windows to be shown above the remote desktop. This makes
        hotkeys such as Shift-Ctrl-Alt-O useful in the full-screen mode.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        A number of bugfixes -- copying clipboard to non-authenticated clients in Xvnc, delayed cursor shape updates in
        Xvnc, and crashing on switching between KDE virtual desktops in vncviewer.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix viewer:</font>
        Support for the new -autopass option has been added, a patch from Ki NETWORKS, Inc.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other changes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.3dev4, development version</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Featuring updated Unix version and Java viewer, supporting RFB protocol version 3.7, with or without TightVNC
        protocol extensions. Version 3.3 of the protocol is supported as well.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Built-in Java viewer was absent in the previous development version; now it's available again.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Now the server does not crash on remote Ctrl-Alt-Del events, and on changing display modes.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        A problem with reinstalling the service has been fixed (WinVNC -reinstall command-line option). In previous
        versions, reinstalling the service could fail if a user did not close "Service unregistered" message box within
        a few seconds.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Now the server does not hang on selecting equal RFB and HTTP port numbers. A warning is shown instead.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        The server does not hang on toggling loopback connection options, and on changing port/display numbers.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        WinVNC does not crash on choosing "Kill All Clients" during file download.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        CopyRect handling in the server has been fixed, the CopyRect encoding is enabled again.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        The Advanced Properties dialog of the server has been removed. The controls of that dialog has been moved to
        tabs in the Properties dialog.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Context help in the server's Properties dialog has been implemented (although not all descriptions are ready
        yet).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix viewer:</font>
        Fixed a bug with the viewer crashing on selecting text in Xvnc, and then choosing F8 / Clipboard: local -&gt;
        remote, twice.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>There was some progress on supporting pluggable encryption and authentication methods, in both Win32 and Unix
        versions, and in the Java viewer.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other changes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.3dev3, Win32 development (unstable) version</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All features and fixes from 1.2.9 and 1.3dev1 versions included.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Improved GUI of the viewer featuring toolbar, hotkeys, pre-set connection profiles, more configuration options,
        context help in dialogs, and more. Finally, the viewer remembers all per-connection and global settings in the
        registry.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>File transfers between viewer and server machines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Support for RFB protocol version 3.7, with TightVNC extensions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>A possibility to turn off hooking via VNCHooks.dll in WinVNC while full screen polling is in use.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other changes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.9</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Major security-related bug in the server has been fixed -- handling of the "QueryAllowNoPass" option was
        seriously broken. Together with fixing this bug, the whole authentication logic in the server code has been
        redesigned.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Now the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive is being closed properly on restoring display settings, on disconnect.
        This change should solve the problem with unloading the registry on logout, when WinVNC is running as a service.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Problems with "QuerySetting" and "QueryTimeout" options have been fixed -- the settings could be copied from
        user configuration to default settings without user's intention.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        A long-standing bug has been fixed -- the logic to handle retries after authentication failures was flawed, and
        used to delete the same object twice under certain conditions.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Now it's possible to specify port numbers with the winvnc -connect option, using the "host::port" format. Also,
        providing a -connect option without arguments now brings up the "Add New Client" dialog.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        New "Request refresh" button has been implemented in the viewer's F8 popup menu.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Xvnc compilation fixes for HP-UX and MacOS X have been applied, from Ki NETWORKS, Inc.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        New vncpasswd -f command-line option has been implemented. It allows providing passwords on stdin and writes
        encrypted passwords to stdout. In addition, the password file name "-" now denotes stdout. Finally, a buffer
        overflow has been fixed in vncpasswd -- it could be caused by a long file name in the command line.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        A patch to fix input focus problems in the X11 viewer has been applied, from Greg Breland.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        A patch fixing Xvnc crashes on Sparc has been applied, from the RealVNC distribution.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        A problem with incorrect port interpretation has been fixed, in the vncviewer's -tunnel option handling. Thanks
        to Clark Sessions.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        A modification from Bernd Krueger-Knauber has been accepted, to pass through X keysyms for foreign currencies.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        The problem with initial keyboard focus not set to the desktop on some JVMs has been fixed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other minor improvements and bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.8</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix and Win32 versions:</font>
        Support for a separate view-only password has been implemented. Now the servers support two passwords -- one to
        allow full control, another to restrict remote keyboard and mouse input.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        The password reset problem has been solved. In versions starting from 1.2.4, the password could get changed in
        the registry on opening Properties dialog and just hitting the OK button.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        New "-reload" command-line option has been implemented in Win32 server. It forces the running instance to reload
        the registry settings.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        "RemoveWallpaper" and "LockSetting" options have been made configurable in the Properties dialog; the code has
        been ported from RealVNC 3.3.6.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Support for "AllowEditClients" registry setting has been ported from RealVNC 3.3.6.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        New "-x11cursor" option has been implemented in vncviewer; a patch from Peter Astrand. This option allows using
        a real X11 cursor with X11-style cursor shape updates, disables the dot cursor, and disables cursor position
        updates in non-fullscreen mode.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        New "RunCommand" command to customize the X11 vncviewer popup menu has been implemented; a patch from Peter
        Astrand.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Several patches from Debian Linux have been applied. This should fix a number of bugs and improve building on
        some platforms supported by Debian Linux.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        A problem with Xvnc eating all CPU time after xfs restarts has been fixed; a patch from Martin Koegler.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other minor improvements and bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.7</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix and Win32 versions, Java viewer:</font>
        The most significant problem with local cursor handling has been solved -- now clients can see remote cursor
        movements performed on the server or by another client. New PointerPos encoding and cursor shape updates both
        minimize bandwidth requirements and greatly improve responsiveness of the mouse pointer, while still allow to
        track correct pointer position in all situations.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix and Win32 versions:</font>
        In all the places where display numbers had to be used, now it's easy to use port numbers as well. The viewers
        now allow to use new "hostname::port" syntax, in addition to the traditional "hostname:display" format. The same
        new syntax can be used in the "Add new client" dialog of Win32 server. In the server, now it's equally easy to
        set display and port numbers. Besides that, HTTP and RFB port numbers can be set individually.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix and Win32 versions:</font>
        In servers, decreased JPEG quality factors for low quality levels. This improves bandwidth usage while the image
        quality remains satisfactory in most cases. In clients, JPEG compression is now enabled by default, because
        usually it's a reasonable choice. To prevent viewers from requesting JPEG compression, new -nojpeg option can be
        used.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix and Win32 versions:</font>
        Improved installer under Windows, better RPMs for Linux.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Major enhancements in layout and functionality of the dialog boxes.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        New keyboard handling code has been ported from RealVNC 3.3.6. This should solve all the issues with arrow keys
        acting as numbers in console windows, and shift+arrows not working under Win2k.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Adopted WinVNC -reinstall option from RealVNC 3.3.5, together with a number of other changes in different
        places. The viewer now accepts a port number after the -listen command-line option, an improvement from RealVNC
        3.3.6.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Eliminated high CPU usage on the server before sending cursor shape updates.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Bugfix for Xvnc's -localhost and -interface options that were broken on many systems, thanks to Luke Mewburn for
        the bugfix. Xvnc -version command-line option is now supported.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Tight encoding is now documented in rfbproto.h files within source archives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Implemented new buttons "Login again" and "Close window" near the disconnect or error messages in the applet
        mode, and introduced new "Offer Relogin" parameter to control this improvement. Thanks to Peter Astrand for the
        initial version of the "Login again" patch.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Support for connections via HTTP proxies using HTTP CONNECT method. This will not work in the applet mode, due
        to Java security restrictions.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Extra .vnc files have been removed, having just index.vnc should be enough. Also, an example HTML page has been
        prepared, to simplify installation under a standalone Web server.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Added a MANIFEST to the JAR archive, to allow easy execution of the JAR file, using java -jar command-line
        option.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other minor improvements and bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.3dev1, Win32 development (unstable) version</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented partial screen sharing. Any single window or any rectangular screen area can be shared instead of
        the whole screen. The position and dimensions of the shared screen area can be changed dynamically, and client
        windows will adjust their dimensions on the fly. The user interface to choose shared screen area is very
        intuitive and easy to use.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Screen resolution changes won't cause WinVNC to disconnect clients any more (but changes in screen color format
        still result in disconnects, this will be fixed later).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>It's possible to make WinVNC ignore remote inputs when local mouse or keyboard is in use. Remote events will be
        re-enabled after a specified timeout (3 seconds by default).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>There may be other changes I forgot to mention. :-)</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.6</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        In this version, when WinVNC binds to a local TCP port, it does not try to check several times if the port is in
        use. It just re-uses the port if the display number is not set to "Auto". One visible effect of this change is
        that the delay between starting up and showing the icon is greatly reduced.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Fixed the bug which caused the vncserver script to fail when the XAUTHORITY environment variable was not set.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Fixed the bug which prevented the vncpasswd utility from setting correct permissons on the passwd file.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Fixed a repeated challenge replay attack vulnerability, bugtraq id 5296.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Added files to simplify building of Linux RPMs, thanks to Peter Astrand.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Improved scrolling in the full-screen mode, modified patch from Ville Herva.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Minor cleanups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.5</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Fixed a problem in the I/O subsystem that was introduced in TightVNC 1.2.2 and was causing major slowdown in
        communication with clients.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Enabled remote upgrade in the installation script. Also, the installer will install a copy of the TightVNC Web
        site, and will create shortcuts to most important documentation pages.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Implemented new feature to specify applet parameters in URL requests being sent to the built-in HTTP server.
        Added support for new "EnableURLParams" registry setting which can be used to enable this feature.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Added support for the NewFBSize pseudo-encoding allowing to change framebuffer geometry on the fly on server's
        request.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Included "solution" and "project" files for MS Visual Studio 7, from Andrew van der Stock, applied a set of
        minor fixes to suppress compilation warnings under MS Visual Studio 7.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        The viewer now tries to preserve the size and position of the desktop window after applying new connection
        options.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Implemented new feature to specify applet parameters in URL requests being sent to the built-in HTTP server.
        Added support for new $PARAMS variable in .vnc HTML templates.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Added the possibility to keep users' vnc directories under /tmp, as suggested by Ivan Popov. This mode can be
        enabled by editing the $vncUserDir variable in the vncserver script. Also, new -t option has been implemented in
        the vncpasswd utility which allows to change VNC password files under /tmp.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Applied Xvnc -viewonly patch from Ehud Karni.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Applied Linux/PowerPC Xvnc fix from Peter A. Castro.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Bug fixed: Xvnc failed to reset compression level and JPEG image quality on reading lists of encodings supported
        by clients.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Made the viewer handle XCursor encoding operating on the framebuffer instead of setting new cursors directly in
        X.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        Applied a number of porting fixes from Ki Networks, Inc.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Added new feature allowing to save RFB sessions in FBS files compatible with rfbproxy. This feature works only
        if JVM security manager allows access to the local filesystem, which is usually true only when the viewer is
        used as a standalone application or if the viewer applet is cryptographically signed. New "Record" button will
        appear in the button panel if this feature is enabled.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Added new "ENCPASSWORD" parameter, modified patch from Peter Astrand.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>

        Applied patch from Peter Astrand to fix problems with Swedish keys and broken JVMs.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other minor fixes and cleanups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.4</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        WinVNC crashes on reporting zero statistics were fixed. This should eliminate crashes when using x2vnc and
        win2vnc client programs.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        a problem with listening viewer was fixed. Initiating multiple non-shared connections could crash the viewer
        application.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        real passwords are never placed into the password text control in the WinVNC Properties dialog any more. This
        should prevent grabbing plain-text passwords from that text control.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        logging on errors was improved to provide better diagnosis for errors, especially for those causing the message
        "Connection closed" right after authentication.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        handling of log files was improved. Now WinVNC should be able to save backup copies of log files under
        Win95/98/Me. Also, all log files are now written in MS-DOS/Windows text format instead of the Unix one.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        a problem with reporting error messages in the listening viewer was fixed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        reporting incorrect statistics in the Tight encoder was fixed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        HTML pages and templates for the built-in HTTP server were improved.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        applied patch from Ki Networks, Inc. solving build problems on a number of commercial Unix systems, and fixing a
        number of minor bugs and typos.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        added a possibility to denote standard input with the "-" file name instead of a real password file name.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        fixed a bug causing vncpasswd utility work incorrectly when a file name argument was given in the command line.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        applied patch to solve keyboard focus problems in the full-screen vncviewer, from Peter Astrand. The patch does
        not seem to solve all the issues, but definitely makes things better. New grabKeyboard resource was added to
        control full-screen mode behavior.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        new "Show Offline Desktop" parameter was added to make the desktop still visible even after the remote side has
        closed connection.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        error messages were made much more meaningful.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        keyboard focus problems were fixed. This should prevent opening new windows (e.g. Options or Clipboard) behind
        the active authenticator or desktop window.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        now "R"/"r" keys can be used to request screen updates in view-only mode.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        applied patch from Peter Astrand to fix problems with Swedish keys and broken JVMs.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other minor fixes and cleanups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.3</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix and Win32 versions:</font>
        zlib library was updated to the most recent version (1.1.4) where a potential security issue was fixed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix and Win32 versions:</font>
        fixed blocking I/O problems in built-in HTTP servers. Older versions had to wait while one client finishes his
        transaction, only then they served new client connections, thus making easy denial-of-service attacks possible.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix and Win32 versions:</font>
        updated built-in Java viewer, see details below.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Added support for mouse wheel events. Wheel mouse support is fully compatible and interoperable with Unix
        version where this feature was available for a long time.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version (WinVNC):</font>
        The -connect command-line option now accepts a display number after a hostname.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 version:</font>
        Creating associations for .vnc files in the installer.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer was GREATLY improved:</font>
        the code was converted to Java 1.1, painting techniques were re-designed completely (now the viewer should work
        in MacOS), several new parameters were added, all parameters were documented in the README file. Most important
        new features include: support for 24-bit colors, JPEG support in Tight encoding, RFB Bell message support, new
        "Refresh" button, a possibility to operate in a separate scrollable window, dynamic view-only mode. Many more
        changes were introduces, see the ChangeLog for more information. Please note that new Java viewer class names
        were changed, e.g. vncviewer.jar file has become VncViewer.jar etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        a number of changes in the vncserver script, e.g. the default color depth is now 24, extra delay after Xvnc
        startup removed, font path is now configurable in the beginning of the script, and more.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version:</font>
        zlib library was removed from the core X sources. Instead, both vncviewer and Xvnc now can use either system
        zlib and JPEG libraries, or ones packaged within TightVNC source archive in the lib/ directory. Unix sources are
        distributed in two versions: one with these libraries for those who don't have them installed in the system, and
        another version without libraries, copied directly from CVS, for those who do have zlib and/or JPEG libraries
        installed. In the former case, build procedure would include additional "make libs" step. System libraries will
        be linked dynamically, libraries included in the source archive will be linked in statically.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Unix version now includes comprehensive manual pages for vncviewer, vncserver, Xvnc, vncconnect and vncpasswd
        programs. The vncinstall script in the source distribution now accepts one more parameter allowing to specify
        where to install manual pages.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version (Xvnc):</font>
        a number of patches from Red Hat Linux vnc package were incorporated into the TightVNC codebase. This adds
        support for more architectures including s390 and s390x, adds a possibility to use tcp_wrappers for Xvnc access
        control.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix version (Xvnc):</font>
        several bugfixes, e.g. applied patch to fix crash in the code dealing with font server; fixed word alignment
        problem in raw encoder experienced by Sparc users.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Unix version is no more distributed as patches to a standard VNC release. This is because patches cannot handle
        changes in binary files and handle file removals very inefficiently.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other minor fixes and cleanups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.2</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        long-standing Win9x resource consumption problem has been fixed. Now the server thread does not use blocking
        I/O, and therefore is always ready to process messages from the VNCHooks DLL.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        now built-in HTTP daemon may be enabled and disabled interactively from the Advanced Preferences dialog (this
        setting is saved in new "EnableHTTPDaemon" registry key).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        changes in layout and text of the Advanced Preferences dialog.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Xvnc:</font>
        Minor bugfix which should prevent potential dereference of a NULL pointer.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix viewer:</font>
        Now viewer window would be raised on beep (bell) event, unless new -noraiseonbeep option is provided in the
        command line or "raiseOnBeep" resource set to False.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>One more packaging option for the Unix source: ready to build archive with Zlib and JPEG libraries inside.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other minor fixes and cleanups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.1</h3>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 server:</font>
        added support for reverse connections on ports other than 5500, modified patch from Steve Kann.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Win32 viewer:</font>
        added support for new command-line options: -noshared and -encoding XXX.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Bugfixes in Win32 viewer:</font>
        changes in exception handling eliminate Borland C++ compilation problems causing application crashes on
        repetitive connections, notably in the listen mode. Also, now warning exceptions causing disconnects are
        reported to user, except for the case when a user has closed the viewer window.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Better packaging in Win32 version:</font>
        self-installing package is available, vncviewer now shows correct icon image.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix vncviewer:</font>
        Default tunneling command template has been changed, to allow tunneled connections to hosts where only loopback
        VNC connections are enabled. New -via &amp;lt;GATEWAY&gt; command-line option provides enhanced tunneling
        functionality, now one can make vncviewer tunnel connections to a VNC host via third machine acting as a
        gateway.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Java viewer:</font>
        Addition of new parameters PASSWORD, "Show Controls", and "View Only", modified patch from Steve Kann.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TightVNC 1.2.0</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tight encoding is now configurable and can operate at different compression levels where low compression levels
        are very fast in terms of CPU usage. New "-compresslevel N" option implemented in vncviewer to set compression
        levels for Tight encoding (1 - fast, 9 - best).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Enhanced techniques to split large rectangles in Tight encoder; now it tries to find large solid-color areas and
        send them in separate rectangles.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Lossy JPEG compression in Tight encoding has been implemented, new "-quality N" vncviewer option should be used
        to enable this feature (0 - low image quality and best compression, 9 - best image quality). JPEG compression is
        used only for screen areas that seem to be suitable for JPEG compression (although algorithms to detect such
        areas are not perfect, of course).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>New "XCursor" and "RichCursor" encodings implemented. They are used to transmit cursor shape updates from server
        to clients ("local cursor" feature requested by many users). Mouse movement no longer causes framebuffer updates
        to happen, vncviewer processes mouse locally when this feature is active. New -nocursorshape vncviewer option
        turns this feature off.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>A number of recent changes from both TridiaVNC and AT&amp;T's releases merged into the source, now the code is
        based on version 3.3.3r2 for Unix part, and on 3.3.3r9 for Win32.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Unix vncviewer:</font>
        When -tunnel option is specified in the command line, special rules are now used to choose preferred encoding.
        Now viewer does not think that server is running on the same machine when tunneling is on and the preferred
        encoding is now "tight" with default compression instead of raw.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Xvnc:</font>
        Rules to set default pixel formats have been changed: now they are RGB565 instead of BGR556 for color depth 16,
        and RGB888 instead of BGR888 for depth 24. This makes Xvnc compatible with Imlib renderer used in Gnome and also
        helps to avoid unnecessary pixel format translations in many cases.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#007000">Xvnc:</font>
        X11 modifier mapped to META key is now Mod4 instead of Mod1. New -compatiblekbd option implemented in Xvnc to
        force META and ALT keys behave the same way as they do in the original AT&amp;T's version.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>A number of bugs fixed: viewer crashes after inflate() call, Xvnc CoRRE encoding problems, Xvnc bit-order issues
        in XCursor and RichCursor encodings, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Java viewer now supports Tight encoding and cursor shape updates. Drawing techniques were changed, settings "Raw
        pixel drawing: Fast/Reliable" and "CopyRect: Fast/Reliable" removed from the Options panel since they do not
        make sense in new drawing model.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Other new features, optimizations, fixes and cleanups, see ChangeLog files.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VNC Tight Encoding 1.1</h3>
<ul>
    <li>New ``gradient'' filter implemented in servers (it can be disabled in Xvnc with new -lazytight option). The
        filter preprocess full-color screen areas prior to compression in order to achieve better compression ratios
        (with the cost of slower compression). Vncviewers of version 1.0 had support for this filter already, but there
        was small bug causing image distortions in certain cases. So it is recommended to upgrade both servers and
        viewers.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Stupid bug fixed: extra unused color was included in palettes in many cases; compression ratios used to be worse
        than they should be.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The algorithm used to split large rectangles into parts has been changed. This change can increase compression
        ratios in many situations.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Byte-order issues in servers have been (hopefully) fixed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Performance tuning, code rewrites and cleanups in various places.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VNC Tight Encoding 1.0</h3>
